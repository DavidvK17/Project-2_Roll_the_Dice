#Roll the Dice

This is my second project.

On document load player 1 is active. By clicking on "roll dice", a random dice roll is generated by my script and displayed by a nice animation for the user. If the dice roll !1 the dice value is added to the players score. If the player clicks on "hold", his score is added and saved to the current score. If his current score is >10 he wins, otherwise it is the other players turn. If a player rolls 1 he looses all his unsaved score points and it is the other players turn to play.

When one player wins only "new game" can be clicked, resetting the game and restoring player 1 as the starting player.
